## Hi!

I'm a software developer. I like exploring new approaches in solving problems, along with learning tried and tested methods. I'm very interested in Haskell.

I'm learning:
- Elixir
- Haskell
- Scala

My learnings can be viewed publicly on [my stream](https://twitch.tv/imsekun), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUa0_AVebTfZzyzXjfB4dJQ). I'm also working on some public projects on [Main.hs](https://github.com/mainhs).
