## Hi!

I'm Sek Un, a fullstack developer with a focus on backend. I mostly use Elixir for my projects unless it isn't suitable. I'm also actively learning more about the functional programming paradigm through Haskell.

I'm passionate in learning on building reliable and scalable systems, and learning interesting technologies that help with this goal.
