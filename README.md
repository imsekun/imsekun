## Hi!

I'm a software developer. I like exploring new approaches in solving problems, along with learning tried and tested methods. I'm very interested in Haskell.

I'm learning:
- Elixir
- Haskell

My learnings can be viewed publicly on [my stream](https://twitch.tv/imsekun), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUa0_AVebTfZzyzXjfB4dJQ).
