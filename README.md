## Hi!

I'm Sek Un, a software engineer with a passion for building reliable, and scalable systems. I've professionally worked as a front-end developer, and as a UI/UX engineer. I've since then wanted to expand my skillset by working on areas that I have little to no experience in. Currently, I'm professionally working as a fullstack engineer for a software development, and consultancy firm [Onilixir](https://onilixir.com).

I have a strong interest in the functional programming paradigm. I've been developing with [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang) for almost a year now, and have used it on several projects for clients. I'm learning Haskell to further expand my knowledge.
